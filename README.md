# FlipperMusicRTTTL
Selection of RTTTL .txt files that will work with the FIipperZero Music Player. 

*As of Release 0.58.1 the Muisc Player should be supported, if not use Unleashed or MuddledBox.*

Create a "music_player" folder on the root of the SD card, place files inside that folder.
Subdirectories are currently not supported on the latest build.

Make sure you are downloading the .txt file and not a .html for them to work.

Feel free to add or make any changes.

Adding a new folder called "ArcadeTones", it will contain newer additions.
