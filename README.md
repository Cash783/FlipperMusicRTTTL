# FlipperMusicRTTTL
Selection of RTTTL .txt files that will work with the FIipperZero Music Player. 
*As of now you may need custom firmware for these to work*

Create a "music_player" folder on the root of the SD card, place files inside that folder.

Make sure you are downloading the .txt file and not a .html for them to work.

For the full archive download rtttl3.zip from this repo.
